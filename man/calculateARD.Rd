\title{Calculate average residual disparity}
\usage{
calculateARD(Yval = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Yval}{The value of Y for which to evaluate the risk ratio.
Defaults to 1, so returned risk ratio will be for P(Y=1)}
}
\value{
ARD The average residual disparity after intervening on M
}
\description{
This function calculates the average residual disparity.  If the treatment A
can be a cause, this is equivalent to the controlled direct effect, 
marginalized over the distribution of the confounders as observed in the A = 1
population.  For this to be meaningful as a residual disparity measure, A = 1
should be the relatively disadvantaged population (i.e., the one we would
intervene on).  Function requires A, Y.par, U.par, M.par, fam, and Xmats to 
be in the environment
